# Hello World
Since I don't have any commits in 2013 I kinda just wanted to leave a message to curious bypassers.

```

#   #                  #     #

```

# Instructions
First we need the picture, a 7 line by, at most, 53 character wide file.
Trailing whitespace is significant.
This file can then be formated using the script as follows:
```cat data.raw | node formatData.js > data```

Then it is as simple as running the script `./committer.sh`
